Tracking Project used in the World Robotic Sailing Championship in 2016 (URL to be announced) see http://www.wrsc2016.com/ for more informations.

In this project, we collect GPS data with electronic devices and send them to the website. Then we provide functions for viewers and competitors such as real-time display and access to the GPS data to process scoring calculations.
